EMOJI-ANALYSIS-PROJECT

using Numpy and Pandas, I have analysed data of emojis. More specifically:

-How different genders use emojis
-The trend of emojs used in each social media 

I have then plotted graphs of the gathered data using matplotlib. At the bottom of this file I am attempting deeper analysis finding the number of positive/negative number of men/women on each social media. Code will be updated with the finshed analysis.

NOTE: I've made myself aware that my code could me more efficient after completing some other projects. The updated code will also show that I can make my code more efficient
